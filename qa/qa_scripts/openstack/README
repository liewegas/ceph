This directory contains scripts to quickly bring up an OpenStack instance,
attach a ceph cluster, create a nova compute node, and store the associated glance images, cinder volumes, nova vm, and cinder backup on ceph via rbd.

execs is a directory that contains executables that are copied and remotely
run on the OpenStack instance

files is a directory that contains templates used to initialize OpenStack
conf files.  These templates reflect the state of these conf files on 5/17/2016.
If further development is necessary in the future, these templates should
probably be removed and direct editing of the OpenStack conf files should
probably be performed.

These scripts also assume that there is a  rhel iso file named
rhel-server-7.2-x86_64-boot.iso and a ceph iso file named
rhceph-1.3.1-rhel-7-x86_64-dvd.iso in the files directory.  These iso files
can be obtained from the rhel site and are not stored with these scripts.
