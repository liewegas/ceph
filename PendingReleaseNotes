11.0.0
------

* If you have manually specified the monitor user rocksdb via the
  ``mon keyvaluedb = rocksdb`` option, you will need to manually add a file
  to the mon data directory to preserve this option::

     echo rocksdb > /var/lib/ceph/mon/ceph-`hostname`/kv_backend

  New monitors will now use rocksdb by default, but if that file is
  not present, existing monitors will use leveldb.  The ``mon keyvaluedb`` option
  now only affects the backend chosen when a monitor is created.

* The 'osd crush initial weight' option allows you to specify a CRUSH
  weight for a newly added OSD.  Previously a value of 0 (the default)
  meant that we should use the size of the OSD's store to weight the
  new OSD.  Now, a value of 0 means it should have a weight of 0, and
  a negative value (the new default) means we should automatically
  weight the OSD based on its size.  If your configuration file
  explicitly specifies a value of 0 for this option you will need to
  change it to a negative value (e.g., -1) to preserve the current
  behavior.
